Specialized in close quarter combat and high endurance the warrior is an excellent choice for melee combat.<br/><br/> The <b>Assassin’s</b> domain on the other hand is staying in the shadows, pick the fights on his own terms and unleash massive damage in a short amount of time. While rather fragile, the assassin class can switch to a tanking role using avoidance rather than sheer endurance.<br/><br/> The <b>Marksman</b> keeps his enemies at range utilizing bows and firearms and is the supreme ranged combat class of Otherland. With a switch of a stance he can also aid his team with healing and buffs.<br/><br/> The <b>Energizer</b> uses large energy weapons and is the supreme healer in Otherland.Energizers can also quickly switch their role to a very capable ranged damage dealer.<br/><br/> A 5th class is available for those who only want to enter Otherland to socialize.",
